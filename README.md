# SQL Practice

This repostiory stores the SQL databases I used to practice SQL queries. 

The database comes from the Codecademy SQL course. The Codecademy course also outlines how to download SQLite and
how to connect that with the git-bash terminal. This is the method I used to form the quereies.
