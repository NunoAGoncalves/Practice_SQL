# SQL Practice

This repostiory stores the SQL databases I used to practice SQL queries. 

The database comes from the Codecademy SQL course. The Codecademy course also outlines how to download SQLite and
how to connect that with the git-bash terminal. This is the method I used to form the quereies. 

## Codecademy Task

### Task 1

"In order to complete this project, you should have completed the Learn SQL Manipulation and Learn SQL Queries lessons."

This task has been completed.

### Task 2 


"In this project, you’ll answer questions using a database of world population by country.

The schema of the database is:

| Column   |	Type	|    Notes      |
|----------|:----------:|--------------:|
|country   |   STRING	|               |
|population|   NUMBER   | (in millions) |
|year	   |   NUMBER   |	            |

Refer to this schema as you write queries to the database.

When you finish this project, you should be able to answer each the questions that follow using a single SQL query."

This task has been completed. 

### Task 3 

"The first query has already been written for you to answer the following question:

What years are covered by the dataset? (you can manually count the number of years returned).

Continue adding your queries below the first one as you proceed."
